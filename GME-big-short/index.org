* Problems for hedge funds
* Short squeeze
* Brokers and margin call

Brokers got margin call by the clearinghouse.
On other hand, brokers should have margin called the short sellers to cover their positions.
But they did not do that, because it would most certainly cause the short sellers to just default.

If the short sellers were margin called they would be required to buy shares at whatever price and this would put upward pressure to the price.
