* Crypto as an asset

1. no income (like stocks or bonds)
2. no utility (currency as means of payment)

* Crypto as an alternative to credit
*** What is credit?

One of the key features of crypto is its manufactured scarcity.
Whereas current fiat money can be created by the central bank expansion of its balance sheet (increasing both assets and liabilities).
