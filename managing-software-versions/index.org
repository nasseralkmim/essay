* Introduction

Have you ever had to deal with multiple versions of the same C++ software?
Right now I am dealing with those questions: Where should I build the binaries? How can I keep track of which version? How can I keep track of which configuration options? Where should I install it? How to link to the right libraries with a specific version?
A lot to think about and keep track of.
Fortunately, [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] makes things a bit easy (maybe even fun).

In this post, I will go to explain my workflow on how to manage this situation with Org-mode.
The particular software that I am dealing with is [[https://trilinos.github.io/][Trilinos]].
Therefore, another title for this post could be "installing Trilinos for absolute beginners". 

* Keeping track of configuration settings and versions with =:tangle=

I like consistency and order (who doesn't?).
To make this organized, I keep track of configuration files within a code block.
This code block is then exported (tangled) to a specific folder.

For example, let's say we want to install Trilinos[fn:1] on this specific release:

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/.local/src/Trilinos
git describe --tag
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: trilinos-release-13-4-1

Then we create a build folder inside the source directory[fn:2] ~build/trilinos-release-13-4-1/~ where we place our specific configuration[fn:3].
Notice that, in the CMake configuration we specify the =CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=, which is where the installation files will be copied to.
I use ~/.opt~ for prefixed installations[fn:4].

#+begin_src makefile :tangle ~/.local/src/Trilinos/build/trilinos-release-13-4-1/config.cmake
set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/home/nasser/.opt/trilinos-release-13-4-1" CACHE PATH "Set in my config.cmake" FORCE)

#+end_src

In this block, I use the source block header option with the tangle file specification.

#+begin_example
,#+begin_src makefile :tangle ~/.local/src/Trilinos/build/trilinos-release-13-4-1/config.cmake
#+end_example

[fn:1] I like to keep packages source codes inside ~~/.local/src~. The ~~/.local~ seems to be the [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html][standard]] here.  

[fn:2] Convention: I like to build in a ~build/~ folder in the source directory. If multiple builds are expected one can create subdirectories for each version/configuration (a.k.a "prefix").

[fn:3] This configuration file makes it "traceable", so you know which configuration was used. 

[fn:4] One could also "install" in the same build folder.  This would make things a little more contained. But, build files sometimes are often disposable and you want to keep just the libraries/header to be used elsewhere. That is why I put it in ~/.opt/~, which is a local user (no need for root permission) version of ~/opt/[fn:5].

[fn:5] [[https://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#OPTADDONAPPLICATIONSOFTWAREPACKAGES]] 

* Configuring and building

Now that the configuration setting is defined and properly stored, we can continue to configure and build.

#+begin_src sh
TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR=trilinos-release-13-4-1
cd ~/.local/src/Trilinos/build/$TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR
rm -f CMakeCache.txt
cmake -D Trilinos_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE=config.cmake ../../ | tee config.out
make -j32
make install
#+end_src

We can check the installation by "grepping" the Trilinos version in the installation directory.

#+begin_src sh
grep -R def.*TRILINOS_VERSION_STRING ~/.opt/trilinos-release-13-4-1/include
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /home/nasser/.opt/trilinos-release-13-4-1/include/Trilinos_version.h:#define TRILINOS_VERSION_STRING "13.4.1"

In Org mode, I use the [[https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sr.ht/~niklaseklund/detached.el/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjNl_eA7Jn9AhXqxwIHHVsUCi4QFnoECAoQAg&usg=AOvVaw1P7qtc_mkzNpopXCkrjB2n][Detached]] package, which runs this shell command in a process independent of emacs.
This works like an "async" feature, and the result is that it does not block emacs.
It could be even used to run things on another computer.

* Using the specific Trilinos version in a "downstream" application

After installing the specific version we can use it (linking/including) in our application (a.k.a downstream application).
The downstream application combines the Trilinos packages to solve a problem.
For instance, use Belos Krylov solver with MueLu preconditioner to solve a linear system iteratively.

Here I will use CMake to configure my build files to automatically find the libraries that I want to link to and include.

** CMake /prefix path/

CMake /config files/ allow CMake to find the packages with =find_package= function.
For Trilinos, there is this option that is turned on by default.

#+begin_src sh
grep "ENABLE.*CMAKE_CONFIG_FILES.*BOOL" build/CMakeCache.txt
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Trilinos_ENABLE_INSTALL_CMAKE_CONFIG_FILES:BOOL=ON

On the "downstream" project, if a nonstandard location is used for the installation, we need to tell CMake where to look for the config files with[fn:73],

#+begin_src sh
-D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<where you installed>
#+end_src

Or in the ~CMakeLists.txt~ directly[fn:74]

#+begin_src makefile
list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "<where you installed>")
#+end_src
