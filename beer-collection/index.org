*** 4/5 Schleppe - No. 1 Pale Ale

Good fresh hop, not too bitter, with a pungent after taste.
This one is nice as a starter, but not for continuous drinking.

*** 3/5 Stiegl - Columbus
Good value/quality ratio. 
Pale ale with enjoyable taste, not too sharp hop flavor.

*** 1/5 Stiegl - Goldbrau
Yellow and refreshing, not my particular kind of beer but can be a good choice on hot days.
