I recently started my PhD at the University of Innsbruck, and will start share some of my day to day life and work here.

Innsbruck is the capital of a region called Tirol.
It is not a big city, the first thing I noticed when arrived here through the train station is how quick you can get to places with the rail train system.

The city is very organized, and I was really impressed with the tiny gap between the rail train and the concrete sidewalk.
Good construction standards.

I have arrived at the end o winter and the temperatures get to around 0Â°C.
It is fine, with a light fleece and a windbreaker is good enough to stand the weather.
