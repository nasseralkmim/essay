Usually Krylov subspace methods are presented as separate category of iterative procedure from classic iterative methods based on splitting the system matrix.
Here I'm going to try to present both as faces of the same coin.
* Objective
1. Fixed point methods from splitting matrix.
   1. can be interpreted as a fixed point iteration associated with a splitting. 
2. Rewrite the expression in terms of the residual.
3. Krylov subspace columns appear from this.
   1. but they appear with a specific linear combination.
4. How to find the ideal linear combination of the Krylov columns?
   1. how is this connected with CG (making r orthogonal) and GMRES (making r min)
* Krylov
# Saaditerativemethodssparse2003
1. approximation form, LC of krylov orthonormal basis
2. residual using this approximation
3. LC coefficients from least square problem
