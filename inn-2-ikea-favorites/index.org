* Why Ikea is so good?

The one thing that makes IKEA aesthetics stand out is /consistency/.

* Bags

The large bag, which costs only 0,79 EUR are good for laundry, groceries, moving things around.
It is also good because it packs small and can be easily carried.

The smaller ones can be used for organizing clothes in the wardrobe and be used as packing cubes when traveling.

* Pots and pans

In regards cooking utensil, IKEA offers the most quality for the price.
For those who are *natural optimizers* like myself, there is no better place to look at.

The OUMBÃ„RLIG set is the perfect one for me.
It has some quality aspects like a heavy bottom layer to distribute heat more evenly, metal handles and good quality stainless steel.
I only use the frying pan with Teflon and the small pot.

The other less expensive options had a very thin layer of metal and plastic handles, which would diminish their durability.
