Both are used to generate an orthogonal basis, but do you know the difference?
We often see them as separate chapters in the book, however we can gain a lot of understanding by looking them side-by-side.
We can have a better understanding of a subject by creating connections between different but relatable concepts (you should definitely read "Surfaces and Essences").
Here I attempt to highlight similarities and differences of both methods.
