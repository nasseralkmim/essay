Muppet I did, and he is pretty unconcerned. He reckons we could
approach 90% passive and we might not notice any issues, and that will
take a long long time.. He points out - rightly - that there are
plenty of companies that are mostly owned by the founder or parent
company, but no one thinks that price discovery is materially
impaired. But he IS concerned at the industry's increasing
concentration. Given the power of incumbency and advantages of scale,
the big three are likely to only get bigger, so this issue will become
bigger as well.
