Fischer's quote:
#+begin_quote
stock prices are informative if they are between “one-half” and “twice” their fundamental values.
#+end_quote

Here he is saying that when in normal times, in the range [0.5, 2], stock prices are in fact informative.
However when an event that largely deviates from the standard deviation (Mandelbrot), we call this event a Black Swan (Taleb), stock prices does not contain information about value.
