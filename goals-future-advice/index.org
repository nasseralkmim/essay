* Where you want to be?

Where you want to be in 5 years? What you want to do after graduating? What do you want graduate in?
Hard questions.
You are better off not creating too much future expectation because the future outcome may be very little in your control.

The better advice is to "stay upwind".
Given the choices in front of you, choose the one that will allow you to be higher.
This heuristics is good because it does not depend on the uncertain future.
