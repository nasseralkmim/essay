* "TODO" lists
** Start the TODO with a question
Instantly knows what to look for.

I prefer this one because it primes you better.
It the TODO text you are know what to expect to accomplish.

** Start the TODO item with a verb
Instantly knows what action to take.
It is effective but too general.
Use it rarely.

Use only when there is no known goal/objective.


* Periodic reviews
** Week reviews
Micro goals and intentions for the week.

Each end of the week you should reflect on it and iterate the process to improve or adapt.
** Month reviews
Medium term goals.

Not too precise, but just to give you an idea of effort to results.
** Year reviews

Macro goals.

Idealistic and just also to give an idea of effort and results.
