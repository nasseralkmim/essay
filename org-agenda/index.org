* Introduction

When tasks start to pile up, we can not rely only on our brain power.
It is a relief to rely on tools that can empty our minds from all the scheduling madness.
In this post, I will go over some /simple/ workflow for keeping track of events (or tasks).
It is my workflow, I'm not attempting to write something general for everyone.
Take it as inspiration.

Notice the emphasis on /simple/.
There is no point in deliberately adding complexity to our lives.
Only /simple/ is welcomed.

* Overview

1. Capture event[fn:1].

[fn:1] Something that happens at specific date. Optionally, it can have a duration, location and other details.   

* Google calendar synchronization

* What to do with events that have passed?

If an event passed.
I acted on it or not.
The way =org-mode= allows us to differentiate that is with =TODO= and =DONE= keywords.
