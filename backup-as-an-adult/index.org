* Introduction

After a couple of year of relying on Onedrive as a backup solution for my documents, I decided to find an alternative.

One in the computer hard disk, one as a =restic= backup in the cloud storage (Backblaze B2).

The documents are gathered in the main computer from cellphone and other computers using =syncthing=.
In the main computer, the sync folder "only receives" which means that if accidentally deletes or modifies files, they will be intact on the source.
Errors will not propagate.

Then, =restic= runs daily as a timer unit and directly save to the Backblaze B2 bucket repository.
